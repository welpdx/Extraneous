# Bulverism
## Defined
[Bulverism wiki](https://bit.ly/3khuaxn)
- The method of Bulverism is to "assume that your opponent is wrong, and explain his error."
- The Bulverist assumes a speaker's argument is invalid or false and then explains _why_ the speaker came to make that mistake (even if the opponents's claim is actually right) by attacking the [speaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem#Circumstantial) or the speaker's [motive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive "Appeal to motive").


- Assuming one's opponent is wrong is a formal fallacy of [circular reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning "Circular reasoning").
- Undermining one's opponent rather than arguing that he is wrong is a [fallacy of relevance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_relevance "Fallacy of relevance") or [genetic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy "Genetic fallacy"). Bulverism combines both of these. 
	- One not only assumes one's opponents are mistaken, but also accuses them of believing the mistakes because of their motives or some accidental features of who they are.

## Examples: 
Of one many examples:
Appeal to identity
-   Female Panelist: "Men face common instances of discrimination."
-   Feminist: "You only say so because of your internalized misogyny."

(The feminist assumes that men do not face common instances of discrimination and uses the construct of internalized misogyny to explain why the panelist is incorrect.)

> There are two questions that people who say this kind of things ought to be asked. The first is, Are all thoughts thus tainted at the source, or only some? The second is, Does the taint invalidate the tainted thought—in the sense of making it untrue—or not? If they say that all thoughts are thus tainted, then, of course,

bulverism = genetic fallacy / fallacy of relevance + undermining one's opponent rather than arguing
