# Etymology
[Slacktivism (wiki)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacktivism#Use_of_the_term)
- The term appears to have been coined by **Dwight Ozard and Fred Clark** in 1995 at the [Cornerstone Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Festival "Cornerstone Festival"). The term was meant to shorten the phrase slacker activism, which refers to bottom up activities by young people to affect society on a small, personal scale (such as planting a tree, as opposed to participating in a protest). The term originally had a positive connotation.

	- Activism that seeks projects and causes that require the least amount of effort
	- Mikkelson says teachers setting up Internet projects underestimate the pleasure people get out of doing something that feels like a public service yet requires no more than a few keystrokes. "It's all fed by **slacktivism**," she said, "the desire people have to do something good without getting out of their chair."  
		—Barnaby J. Feder, "They Weren't Careful What They Hoped For," _The New York Times_, May 29, 2002
	- In 1995, two students at the University of Northern Colorado circulated by e-mail a petition to rally people to protest government cutbacks in PBS, National Public Radio and the arts. In order to ensure it reached as many people as possible, it included the words, "Forward this to everyone you know." . . . Those who wage the seemingly futile war to rid the Internet of such e-mails have given a name to the practice of keeping such e-mails alive: They call it "slacker activism," or "**slacktivism**" (the term preferred by slacker typists). It's not that these e-mails don't intend to do good, the experts say. It's that they go about it in a way that can too easily become utterly meaningless.  
		—Month Phan, "On the Net, "**slacktivism**'," _Newsday_, February 27, 2001
	- This shortened form of the phrase _slacker activism_ had a <ins>brief appearance in a Usenet posting in 1995</ins>, and then didn't appear again until 2000 in a discussion concerning people whose idea of activism is clicking the "Forward" button in their e-mail software. Media references to **slacktivism** didn't appear until 2001.\

## ideas
 - China using social media to spread propaganda and attempts to be "activists" 
	- they protest against those who say that the CCPVirus came from China claiming it to be racist.  (Ironic considering that the CCP condemned Wuhan in early 2020 to save face.)
	
- There is now software that uses machine learning to generate coherent sentences and paragraphs. One single hacker can pretend to be milions of users with ease, and spread a narrative in the hacker's liking
