### WRITING THE SUMMARY

1. First, identify the thesis (controlling idea + reason\[s\]) and any other supporting ideas. Separate these ideas from the details used to explain them. For the purposes of learning to separate ideas from details, it is good practice to learn to write summaries that omit any detail that is not crucial to expressing a central point. How long should a summary be? Again, you will want to satisfy different expectations for different assignments. Since good writing expresses one main idea per paragraph (i.e., a unit of 5–10 sentences), try to follow the rule of thumb of using no more than one or two sentences for each paragraph of the original. In most cases, your summary should be less than one-quarter the length of the source. 
2. The second main skill required for a summary is to express the writer’s ideas in your own words without altering the original meaning. the summary itself should not express your personal responses to what you are summarizing. Using the third-person voice
 
Note on neutral tone: One of the greatest obstacles to successful reading is an emotional resistance to finding and “giving time” to ideas that we oppose or don’t initially understand. We all have a tendency to shape discussions on a topic into ideas we have already received or formed, and even to dismiss a complex discussion before completing it. Whether or not you agree with what Robertson Davies says in his essay, your goal as summarizer is to capture his ideas impartially. Once you have done that, once you have recognized his claim and his reasons, you are in a stronger position to develop a critique of his position.

### Three Tips for Finding the Thesis
1.  Determine who the author is and where the reading was published, which may help you to imagine the intended audience. Knowing the background of the author and his or her intended audience may help you to infer what public attitudes and assumptions preceded and perhaps precipitated the essay you are to summarize.
    
2.  <ins>Scan and skim, concentrating on the title, the opening and closing paragraphs, and the topic and closing sentences of each paragraph.</ins> <ins>From these key locations, you should be able to infer the main topic</ins> (and probably much more). Turn the title of the essay into a question in your mind and read the text seeking an answer to that question: <ins>What is this and why is it important?</ins> Titles may convey the topic and controlling idea or just one or the other. Some titles prefer to pose riddles, not making perfect sense until the essay is completed. For example, some titles state metaphors or allusions; some state the reason for the controlling idea or a warrant (a belief likely held by the social group addressed) but not the controlling idea itself. Your goal is to gather clues from various key locations. As you seek answers, ask yourself what the main assertion (claim) and evidence (grounds) are (see Chapter 18, p. 205).  
    
3.  Skim through paragraphs looking for rhetorical methods: stylistic features of the point of view, language that contributes to a dominant tone, and patterns of organization —a purposeful structure that helps you understand the relationship between ideas and language.



### From Controlling Idea and Reason(s) to Completed Summary

Now that we have identified the writer’s thesis—or made our best attempt to capture it—our work as summarizer is well underway. Without the controlling idea and reasons (thesis), we cannot provide a summary of value. With it, we are ready to move on to the next stage to complete our assignment. To do so, we apply the following 10 steps.

#### Ten Steps to a Successful Summary

1.  Begin by identifying the author and title of the reading.
2.  In your first sentence or short paragraph, re-state the complete thesis (controlling idea and supporting reasons).
3.  Include all significant points (ideas) and only inseparable details (e.g., an analogy that forms the basis of the main argument).
4.  Re-present content in the same order that the author does (but place the thesis at the start, no matter where it occurs).
5.  Make each part of your summary directly proportional to the part it summarizes (e.g., three sentences to compress three paragraphs).
6.  Use a neutral (impartial/objective) tone—third-person point of view. Avoid using your own metaphors or other literary figures of speech, which convey personal voice and a possible tone of critical evaluation.
7.  Exclude any of your own critical response.
8.  Be brief—try to summarize each paragraph or comparable section in no more than a sentence.
9.  Use almost entirely your own language—select only key words for quotation.
10.  Enclose any of the author’s words in quotation marks.
